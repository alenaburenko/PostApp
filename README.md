# PostApp

This is the README file for my project. Here, I will describe how to run the database, backend, and frontend.

## Running the Project

1. Start the database:

   ```bash
   make up
This command will launch the database using Docker Compose.

2. Open a new terminal and start the backend:

bash
Copy code
make backend
This command will navigate to the src/server directory and start the backend using npm start.

3. In another new terminal, start the frontend:

bash
Copy code
make frontend
This command will navigate to the src/frontend directory and start the frontend using npm start.

Now, the database, backend, and frontend should be successfully running. 

Additional Steps
Make sure you have make installed on your system. If you don't have it, you need to install the make package using your operating system's package manager.

Before starting the database, ensure that Docker is installed and running on your machine.

Before starting the backend and frontend, make sure all the required dependencies are installed in the respective folders (src/server and src/frontend). You can install the dependencies by running npm install in each folder.

Note that you may need to configure additional parameters or environment variables in the docker-compose.yml, src/server, and src/client files to successfully run your applications.
